For as long as they can 
remember, fraternal twin brothers Christopher and Trevor Wiitala have 
been playing music in one form or another. Having called Chicago home 
for over 30 years and been raised on music full of passion and melody, 
they continue to do so the best way they know how.

Their self-released, debut album was recorded and mixed themselves in their rehearsal space, office 
storage room as well as the stairwells and long, concrete floored and 
ceilinged building those places are in. It is an album full of 
intertwining melodies and instrumentation that is dark and simplistic, 
melodic and sparse.

Much of the album was written during 
Christopher's battle with hepatitis C, so lyrically there is an 
underlying theme of despair and hopelessness in the songs, but dig 
deeper and you'll find something more.
